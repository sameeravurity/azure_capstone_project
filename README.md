# azure_capstone_project
This project focuses on migrating Tailwind Traders' QuickKart e-commerce website and its database to Azure. The goal is to enhance performance with auto-scaling, automate development through CI/CD pipelines, and leverage Azure PaaS microservices for cost efficiency and reduced administrative overhead.
Tailwind Traders' QuickKart e-commerce website is struggling with slow performance during peak hours and lacks modern development practices. They need to migrate their existing application and database to Azure, implementing auto-scaling for the website, a CI/CD pipeline for automated development, and microservices for improved scalability. Additionally, they require secure storage for confidential data, cost-effective image storage, and robust application monitoring, all while minimizing administrative overhead and overall costs.

Challenges:

Performance Bottlenecks: Addressing the slow response times during peak hours requires proper architectural design for scalability.

Database Migration Complexity: Migrating a database with a strict schema to Azure SQL Database while maintaining data integrity.

Microservices Implementation: Identifying suitable functionalities for microservices and ensuring effective communication and management of these services.

CI/CD Pipeline Setup: Configuring a robust and automated CI/CD pipeline for a multi-technology (Angular and .NET Core) application.

Security and Compliance: Ensuring the secure storage of confidential data and adherence to security best practices throughout the Azure environment.

Cost Optimization: Balancing performance and scalability needs with the desire to reduce costs, especially for image storage and overall Azure resource consumption.

Monitoring Integration: Effectively setting up and leveraging Azure Application Insights to gain meaningful insights into application performance and user behavior.

Legacy System Integration: Potentially dealing with any existing integrations or dependencies that need to be considered during the migration.

Benefits:

Improved Website Performance: Auto-scaling will ensure the website can handle increased traffic during peak hours, leading to a better user experience.

Automated Development: CI/CD pipeline will streamline the development process, enabling faster and more reliable deployments.

Enhanced Scalability and Flexibility: Microservices architecture allows for independent scaling and development of components, improving agility and resilience.

Reduced Operational Costs: Leveraging PaaS services and cost-optimization strategies (like Blob storage tiering) will minimize infrastructure and administrative expenses.

Enhanced Security: Azure Key Vault provides a secure solution for managing secrets, reducing the risk of data breaches.

Better Visibility and Insights: Azure Application Insights offers comprehensive monitoring, enabling proactive identification and resolution of performance issues and better understanding of user behavior.

Reduced Administrative Overhead: Utilizing Azure's managed services significantly reduces the burden of infrastructure management.

Future-Proof Architecture: Migration to Azure and adoption of modern cloud patterns positions QuickKart for future growth and innovation.
Summary of Steps:

Migrate Database: Move the existing product catalog and order database to Azure SQL Database, ensuring schema integrity.

Modernize Web Application: Re-host the Angular 13 frontend and .NET Core 3.1 backend on Azure Web App.

Implement Auto-Scaling: Configure auto-scaling for the Azure Web App to handle peak hour traffic fluctuations.

Adopt Microservices: Decompose relevant backend functionalities into microservices using Azure Function Apps for better scalability and manageability.

Establish CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub/Azure DevOps to automate application development, testing, and deployment.

Secure Sensitive Data: Store confidential data and application secrets (e.g., database connection strings, API keys) in Azure Key Vault.

Optimize Image Storage: Utilize Azure Blob Storage for image storage, implementing cost-saving measures like lifecycle management policies to move infrequently accessed images to cooler tiers (Cool/Archive).

Implement Monitoring: Integrate Azure Application Insights for comprehensive monitoring of the application's performance, user behavior, and potential issues.

General Cost and Admin Overhead Reduction: Throughout the process, prioritize PaaS services and leverage Azure's managed services to minimize administrative burden and optimize costs.
